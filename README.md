Idea 1: Digital Cafe
  Since the first appearances of Covid-19, the world has had to learn new ways to live our every-day lives. While the pandemic may be over, some are still affected. People with autoimmune diseases, severe social anxiety, or limited transportation can still struggle with    
  going out and doing the activities they love. I would like to create a digital cafe- a space where people who may not be able to go to physical cafes can still enjoy the benefits. This website would have coffee and tea reccommendations, links to shop for mugs and other   
  tools, and even a community page where people can post what they're doing. I would love to work with local adoption centers to create a "Cat Cafe" experience as well.

** Idea 2: Video Game Search Engine **
  I am very passionate about video games, and my dream is to work as a developer at a major video game company. I play video games frequently, and when I finish one, I never know what to do next. I know many other people feel this way; they don't know what to do after they finish a game that they love, and they almost feel empty. I would like to create a video game search engine where people can enter the game that they just finished, and get reccommendations for similar games based on game mechanics, content, and art style. I am leaning toward this option because I could see it helping me earn a job with a video game company. I could use their APIs to sort and search for all of the criteria, and it would help to showcase my passion for this field.
